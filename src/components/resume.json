      "I discovered my passion for coding through conversations I had with my previous company on how our business' software was built. The logic and functionality of each piece of the system was very intriguing, and I began researching opportutnies to further my edification in software development fundamentals. I decided to try UDACITY, and after the completion of the Front-End Web Developer course I realized that I wanted more! I went through and received my certification as a Full Stack Developer through Northwestern University's Coding Bootcamp.",
      "I currently am working full time at LLT Group as a Web App Developer. I am hoping to build my experience as a developer and to give back to the open-source community."
